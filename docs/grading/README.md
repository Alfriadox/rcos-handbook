# Grading

RCOS is largely a self-guided class, which can make management and grading difficult. Instructors assign appropriate grades using utilities such as [Observatory](https://rcos.io/) to track open source contributions and community involvement.

Generally speaking, if you're contributing to the community and/or making valuable open-source contributions you'll receive a high grade in RCOS.
