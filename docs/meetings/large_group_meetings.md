# Large Group Meetings

## Overview
- What are large group meetings?
- Where / when do we meet?

## Frequency

During the first two weeks of the semester, large group occurs every Tuesday and Friday to get new community members acquainted with RCOS and to inform existing members on changes in structure and mentorship.

Once all community members are assigned to a small group, large group will only occur on one Friday per month. All other Fridays are reserved for workshops on open-source technologies hosted by the RCOS community.

Large group will also occur on the last Friday of the semester for our closing ceremony. 

## Announcements
Meetings begin with announcements. It's an opportunity for the coordinators to introduce the meeting's speakers & presentations. Any RCOS member is welcome to make an annoucement at the beginning of a meeting (in fact, it's encouraged!).

## Lightning Talks and Sick Picks
  - Lightning Talks are brief talks on anything related to open source.
  - Sick Picks are opportunities to share some open-source technology you have been using.
  - Both Lightning Talks and Sick Picks must contain only 1 slide and may not go over 2 minutes.

## Guest Speakers
RCOS welcomes guest speakers to present their work or research and how it encorporates open-source software.
- TODO - add list of past guest speakers
- TODO - add a link to contact page (i.e. `If you're interesting in being a guest speaker, please contact xyz@rcos.io`)
