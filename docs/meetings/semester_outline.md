# Semester Outline

## Summary

Each RCOS semester is standalone. The first few weeks are used for setting up mentors, small groups, and projects. The middle of the semester - the majority - is spent working on your projects. The last few weeks of the semester are dedicated to final project presentations and wrap up.
