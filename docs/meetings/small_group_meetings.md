# Small Group Meetings

## Overview
- What are small group meetings?
- Where / when do we meet? (TODO - link to times & locations)

## Announcements
Meetings begin with announcements.

## Stand Up
Each project has an opportunity to give their small-group a brief update on their progress over the past week. Follows SCRUM format.

## Presentations
All projects will give a presentation to their small group on their progress at least once per semester. Each presentation will be graded by the small group mentors. If there are no presentations in a small group on a given date, students are encouraged to attend presentations in another small group.

## Open Hacking
The remaining time in the small group meetings is dedicated to working onyour project. This time allocation enables mentors to check in on each project and help resolve problems and guide their ongoing work.
